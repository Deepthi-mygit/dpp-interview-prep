## Interview Tips

1. **Always use project context.** "In our zen-pharma project, we do X because Y" beats a theoretical answer every time.
2. **Know the flow end-to-end.** The most common opener: "Walk me through how code gets to production." Practice this until it's 90 seconds, fluent, with specific tool names.
3. **Know your numbers.** Dev environment cost ~$160/month. RDS PITR window: 35 days. ArgoCD poll interval: 3 minutes. EKS node count: 3 × t3.small. These details signal real experience.
4. **Behavioral questions:** Use the STAR format (Situation → Task → Action → Result). Reference specific incidents from `07-behavioral-realtime.md`.
5. **When you don't know something:** Say "I haven't used that specific tool, but the concept maps to X which we use in our project — in X, the way to handle this is..." Never just say "I don't know."
